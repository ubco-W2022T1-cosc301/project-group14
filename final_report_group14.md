Zaynb Alkhafadi, Connor Doman, Jan Suratos

## Introduction

The dataset we chose was the ride sharing data provided by [Capital Bikeshare](https://capitalbikeshare.com), a Washington D.C. based company. This company is similar to [Lime](https://www.li.me/en-ca/vehicles/scooter) or [Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com) in that they deploy bicycles around the city and users can rent them freely from a mobile app or kiosk. The data was collected over two years, between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012.
