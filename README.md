## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Walkbility is a major factor in quality of life for those who live in cities. Adequate pedestrian infrastructure and accomodations for cyclists and those who walk make city living easier and more affordable. An excess presence of vehicles can make pedestrian travel difficult, dangerous, and polluted. An important aspect of optimizing walkability and ridability is understanding how people currently navigate their city. Our data set is a collection of GPS data from 2011-2012 of all trips taken by all users of the bike share system in Virginia. We will be using this data to understand how people use the bike share system, and how this can be used to improve the system and cities as a whole.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset, provided by University of California Irvine, is about bike-sharing, specifically the hours.csv which is basically about the duration of travel, and location placements of bike-rentals in the years of 2011-2012. Server logs was the method for collecting this data. The purpose of this dataset is due to their important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.
