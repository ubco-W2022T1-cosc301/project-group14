# COSC 301 Group 14 Final Report

## Members

Zaynb Alkhafadi, Connor Doman, Jan Suratos

## Introduction

The dataset we chose was the ride sharing data provided by [Capital Bikeshare](https://capitalbikeshare.com), a Washington D.C. based company. This company is similar to [Lime](https://www.li.me/en-ca/vehicles/scooter) or [Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com) in that they deploy bicycles around the city and users can rent them freely from a mobile app or kiosk. The data was collected over two years, between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012. It's healthier and cheaper to minimize the use of cars in daily commutes and these services work to improve the walkability factor of cities.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Highlights

In support of walkable cities, it was nice to see that ridership trended upwords across the two years.

Despite being an easy prediction, it was interesting to find that ridership goes up Mondayâ€“Friday. It was also interesting to see that registered ridership drops during the weekend, likely since these users are mostly doing so for work.
