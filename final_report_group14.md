# COSC 301 Group 14 Final Report

## Introduction

The dataset we chose was the ride sharing data provided by [Capital Bikeshare](https://capitalbikeshare.com), a Washington D.C. based company. This company is similar to [Lime](https://www.li.me/en-ca/vehicles/scooter) or [Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com) in that they deploy bicycles around the city and users can rent them freely from a mobile app or kiosk. The data was collected over two years, between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012. It's healthier and cheaper to minimize the use of cars in daily commutes and these services work to improve the walkability factor of cities.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Highlights

In support of walkable cities, it was nice to see that ridership trended upwords across the two years.

Despite being an easy prediction, it was interesting to find that ridership goes up Mondayâ€“Friday. It was also interesting to see that registered ridership drops during the weekend, likely since these users are mostly doing so for work.

## Question 1 (Connor)

> _What holidays have the most bike rentals?_

### Results

![Rental Count by Holiday](images/count_by_holiday_barplot.png)

D.C. is a unique location in the United States for holidays. Being the political center of the country, as well as the region in which the Department of Defense is headquartered, Washington sees more patriotic activity than average. Subsequently, in my analysis I found the holiday with the single most bikes rented was Independence Day, 2012.

Surprisingly, the next most popular holiday was April 16, 2012. This did not come up as a holiday on most typical calendars, but according to [this article](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/2012) on _Time and Date_, DC celebrates this day as Emancipation Day. This again follows patriotism expected from the location. This is also Orthodox Easter Monday, but this seems less likely to be widely celebrated in Washington. An interesting observation is that this same day in 2011 had only 49% the ridership of 2012 (3126 vs. 6370).
